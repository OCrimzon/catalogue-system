# catalogue-system
Cataloging system for the EESW challenge.

NOTE - PIP, Pillow, OpenCV and Pyzbar are used to make this program possible. If the program is not running on your device, it may be worth installing these libraries onto your device. Furthermore, ensure your python is up to date (I made that mistake initially!)
